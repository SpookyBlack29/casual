## This item guide is strictly for players who are new and wondering what bosses drop what items. If you are past level 500 refer to the other item guide. You are not required to get any of these items but they will help you get to 500 quicker.

## Note: The starting mobs that you fight will drop a green item that you cannot pick up. It is a end-game item that you will not need. Just ignore it.

When you first start the game, be sure to stop by the dragon in town and purchase the "Z" "X" and "C" items. Also be sure to visit the potion vendor as they sell free 1000 hp pots.
