After you get the stone from the skeletons, head back to the top right of the spawn town and walk into the circle below the house.

Once inside there are 5 different ways to gain stats.

  2. Kill the Finn to gain +200 str/agi (also gives 20k gold)
  3. Kill the giant worm looking thing for it to drops 3-4 books that give +200 str/agi each (also gives 100k gold)
  4. Attack the tree at the bottom of the stat area to have a 10% chance to get +50 str/agi on attack.
  5. Talk to the NPC at the top of stat area to purchase 10 str/ag for 10k gold, 20 str/agi for 20k gold, 50 str/agi for 40k gold, or 500 str/agi for 400k gold.

After you have reached 200k stats you must decide if you want to keep your base character model or choose a skin. The available skins for each class can be seen here: https://cafe.naver.com/casualrpg?iframe_url=/ArticleRead.nhn%3Fclubid=28897517%26articleid=121002%26referrerAllArticles=true. For the second tier you will not be able to choose a skin yet, but if you wish to pick a skin later you will need to use the correct tiering item.

## To get to the boss that drops tier material go to the portal after ronald. 

The boss will drop 2 different materials. The one on the right is used for skin, the left one is used if you wish to stay the base model.**Chosing a skin will cause you to lose your stats on tiering. You will however start with +5k more stats.**
