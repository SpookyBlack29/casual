To reach the first Tier you must first reach level 100.

In the skeleton and pudge area, kill skeletons until you receive this item.

After you get the stone from the skeletons, head back to the top right of the spawn town and walk into the circle below the house.

To reach the second tier you must have 200k BASE stats(stats from items dont count)

To gain stats you can go into this portal

Once inside there are 4 different ways to gain stats.

  1. Kill the Kirby to gain +100 str/agi
  2. Kill the Finn to gain +200 str/agi
  3. Kill the giant worm looking thing for it to drops 3-4 books that give +200 str/agi each
  4. Attack the tree at the bottom of the stat area to have a 10% chance to get +50 str/agi on attack.

After you have reached 200k stats you must decide if you want to keep your base character model or choose a skin. The available skins for each class can be seen by looking in the top right corner of the map. For the second tier you will not be able to choose a skin yet, but if you wish to pick a skin later you will need to kill the golem for your class. If you decide to stay with the base model for your class you can kill the vampire. **Note: If you choose to go with skin your stats will be reset but you will start with +5k to your stats. If you stay with your normal model you will retain your stats.**

If you wish to stay the base model for your class kill this vampire until you receive his drop

After you have aquired the material required for your tier you will need to walk into this area
![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/88e2e35d8b523d480038b9d37de165fa.png)

You will see all 6 classes with a circle infront of them. Walk into your classes circle with the tier material in inventory.


For your last tier you must now farm to 700k stats. After reaching 700k stats, if you have decided to go the skin route, you will have to farm boars for the skin you want. If you decided to not go with a skin you will have to kill the demon.

For non-skin kill this demon

For skins you will have to kill boars. I have marked each boar with a color for each class. 

Knight is the blue X

Priest is the yellow X

Assassin is the red X

Monk is the green X

Debuffer is the purple X

Sniper is the white X

To choose which skin you want you will need Unifont to see korean letters. I will use knight in my example.

You can see in these screen shots that the blue writing in the upgrade material's name is the exact same as the skins name. So all you need to do is keep killing the boar for your class until you get the material with the same name as the skin you want.
