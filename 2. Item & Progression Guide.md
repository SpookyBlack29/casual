## Casual RPG Item Guide created by SpookyBlack with help from iFailz, Aesgeroth and tunafish

If playing older map versions, the Korean Command for create: -조합

## If playing the current and final map version (14.3v) then you just use -create

Start by picking your class in the very top left corner of the map, there is no repick and you can't load if you make a new character. Grab some free starter gear and free health potions from the two shops beside you in the spawn point town. Health potions work both on the hero and backpack, and each different potion has an independent cooldown.

Our first goal is killing the orc boss just south of town and getting our 4th item slot (hp item).

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/97a3c6e6-7286-417e-953a-45bbe2cb12a8)

After that the goal is to hit lvl 100 so we can tier up the first time. If you want you can also kill the next in line spider boss to get a better Atk item (it requires level 30 to equip, optional gear).

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e5dab60b-072b-4834-8e7a-7b9cab22bed8)

When we get level 100 we need to farm a "Fragment of the fallen orc" from the skeletons south of starting town, and bring it back to the house at town to tier up.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/2c6b12b1-636a-4ede-a30c-4b3ee37188a7)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/df3eecd1-6448-4adb-9490-84fd685fb944)

Fun fact, we can use the lvl 100 portal at town to teleport straight back to the skeleton area and save a walk.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/a684db8c-ba15-463e-a6e0-7659972a3aa4)

Now the goal is just to reach lvl 500 and get out of the tutorial zone. You can either grind normally on whatever mobs you can handle and take it slow, or you can rush to 500 the fast way by running down to murlocs in the portal at the very bottom right corner of the tutorial zone. If murlocs are too hard, maybe consider farming snap dragons till around level 200 and then trying again.

There are some minibosses that each drop a single item, but these are all optional as any tutorial zone gear will replaced shortly anyways. They have the required level listed on their description and each fit into a gear slot (only 1 Atk item at a time etc).

In the bottom right corner of the tutorial zone is snap dragons, with a portal in that area. If we jump inside we can farm 50-100 levels per mob off murlocs and hit 500 really fast.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/44479e91-e5e1-48b2-8a1c-ad2176fdb0f8)

## When you reach level 500 you can teleport to the next zones by typing "-1" in chat.

## I highly recommend running putting a pause on item farming and getting some base stats at this point. Farming ~15k stats from the stat tree makes starting off many times easier and only takes a couple minutes. 

The portal to the stat farming area can be found by typing -1 and heading east into the Tower of Oblivion. Inside you will find the "Stat Workshop" portal. When you enter do not run up into Kirby and Finns, run down to the right and you will find the stat tree. Punching the stat tree gives you stats, farm to about ~15k stats, or more if you're in the mood. You will need 200k base STR to tier up a little later (but farming the rest of the stats off the mobs above will be faster than the tree).

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/f3707d03-a348-4fd8-a558-258ecd11f274)

Now that we have some initial stats, it's time to collect our starter gear which will upgrade over the course of the map.

I will refer to items as: Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item/Lifesteal item/ and lastly AOE item.

From the first boss that looks like the Knight class obtain the Lifesteal item. He is just below the skeleton/abomination zone (south of spawn point town). We can go back to the spawn point town using the -suicide command.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/feb66dd930e13821206a2b83ad465d93.png)

From the boss that looks like the swordsman obtain the AOE item. He is at the very top of the -1 teleport zone.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/9a1dd6bc-727f-4751-81c0-cae40339fc75)

After that we work downwards, back towards the -1 teleport spot.

Evil Spirits will be our first boss, kill her until she drops our item set. This item set will basically be your items you keep all game, and will replace anything you are currently wearing. 

**(Evil Spirits can be spawned by killing the sealing stones under the swordsman boss. Upon killing the sealing stone a consumable item will drop, when you activate this item it will spawn 1 boss to far left of the sealing stone.)**

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/765b84b4-3e2d-4ced-bbea-da3427633c47)

The crab upgrades can be used with the "-create" chat command.
For older versions that may use the Korean Command for create: -조합

From the crab upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item once each. **(Crab may be spawned by killing the sealing stone below the evil spirit sealing stone.**

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/25b1185a-377a-4636-b86d-90a3894456c2)

**After upgrading from the crab go back to the skeleton/abomination area (using -suicide) and obtain one of the runes that drops from the abominations. Purify the rune by walking into this circle.**

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/45d447f6-e913-43bb-a1f2-86404db28e8e)

## Pick up the new rune and walk back into the purification circle to upgrade your Atk Speed item.

Kill penguins (above the -1 teleport spot) and upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item 10 times each.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/bf3b3427fe13dfef228c779377dc8340.png)

After you finish your Penguin upgrades, go into the Tower of Oblivion (-1 and go right)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e7de709c-a750-44a9-a2aa-4be97adcc8c5)

You can teleport to the entrance of this portal hub by typing "-1" without the quotes.

Enter this portal and kill Cirno and upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item 10 times each.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/80f183840a7862b1b17563b417fb6567.jpg)

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/ecc7d5e297450b7af1e61719f5f50f31.png)

Proceed to the right side of the Cirno room and take the path to the next portal and then kill Ronald and upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item 10 times each.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/8102bac7f989aa2c35767b44ea11ef8b.png)

Now that we have full Ronald gear it's time to tier up if you haven't already (200k base STR required). Go back to the Stat workshop and farm mobs until you have 200k base STR (anything more than that will be lost on tier up). Once you have that, the portal inside Ronald room leads to the tier boss.

We can either choose Normal Awakening if we want to keep the default skin for most of the map, or we can choose Skin Awakening if you want a different model for your class. 

You can view all the skin options for each class here. https://cafe.naver.com/casualrpg?iframe_url=/ArticleRead.nhn%3Fclubid=28897517%26articleid=121002%26referrerAllArticles=true

If you choose to pick a new skin, you will lose your base stats but gain a permanent +5k allstats for the next tier (to make re-leveling fast). You won't get to choose out of the 3 skins on this tier up, but you will on the next tier up (at which point you won't tier up again for a long long time). The Skin Awakening will just assign you a specific one of those 3 options for right now.

Note that these 5k stats are completely negligable moving forward, as your character will have millions of stats from gear as you progress. If you choose to keep the default skin, you will also retain your 200k stats on tiering up.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/5fa83f09-f47d-428c-b20e-64be77331ef6)

When you've made your choice, bring the single awakening item to the -1 teleport, and go inside the Tower of Oblivion. Hug the pillar on the right and walk into your class circle. Tier up and -suicide back to spawn, then run straight down to the murloc portal and re-level to 500.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/9168dc9f-b443-45e8-9b53-bed3f72c8f17)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/3fc8453e-b548-4e96-8162-01e2ce9473a6)

At this point you have the option to refarm your base stats (in the Stat Workshop portal again), the next tier up requires 700k base STR. If you farm all the stats right now, you can tier up again immediately. This is something I would personally do, but if you're burnt out on stats just farm as much as you want and go back to item farming. Be aware that if you tier up again now instead, you'll be considerably stronger.

If you farmed to 700k Str AND chose a new skin, you need to get your next tier up item from the Thin Crypt portal (boars). If you farmed to 700k Str and chose to keep the default skin, you need to get your tier up item from the Dark Space portal instead of boars.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/8140d47b-02a1-4fd9-9354-05ea3e6b1eea)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/dbc1ad0e-24fc-4392-a018-f6c7a5ae0627)

For farming boars, each class has 3 different skin choices. You can keep the skin you currently are, or pick from two others seen here. https://cafe.naver.com/casualrpg?iframe_url=/ArticleRead.nhn%3Fclubid=28897517%26articleid=121002%26referrerAllArticles=true

When you have your tier up drop, take it back to the -1 pillar same as before. Now you can re-level to 500 and farm stats up to 700k again, then we're done tiering up for a very long time. Back to upgrading items.

## After the Beasts you should upgrade your Atk speed item into wings. The Wings guide shows all the visuals for the options. If you're too lazy/don't care to check the wings guide, go in the wing market portal and buy one of the items from Attack Wing Shop inside and -create it with your attackspeed item. You can try them on first from the Preview Wings shops in the bottom left corner of that zone.

The next area will go in order starting from the top left and ending at the bottom middle of the portal room. I am going to refer to the portals as portal 1 to 10 starting with the top left being 1.

To get to these bosses type "-1" and head south to this portal.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/31f0eef6a6ffd2dd0b699d142eacb49d.png)

Go to portal 1 and kill this boss and upgrade your HP item once. Upgrade your Atk item 10 times. Upgrade your Def Item 20 times.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/7b96d93e346cdbd6e0b4b37f7b27d8bc.png)

Go back to the skeleton and pudge area, grab a rune from pudge and purify it like you did when you upgraded your atk speed item. Pick the rune back up and walk back in to upgrade your HP item.

Go to portal 2 and upgrade your Atk item 20 times

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/cc4877cbf6e2dc78e8a36edda53a7b6b.jpg)

## Continue collecting upgrade materials in portal 2 and then collect an equal amount from this boss in portal 3. Upgrade your Def item 5 times using both upgrade materials at once.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/57686f5722acc845abd6f6c4fd825dc3.jpg)

Go to portal 4, kill this boss and upgrade your hp item 5 times.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/f3e1fd7efb1a9b646ec7147ea2633f67.png)

Go to portal 6 and kill water elementals. Upgrade your Atk item 10 times

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/764d33f9cde3c78e2ca4f14fe2148187.png)

Go to portal 7 and kill the treants. Upgrade your AOE item 15 times. Upgrade your Atk item 5 times. **Mini treants will spawn in the middle as you fight, try and keep them in check as a lot can end up spawning and make it hard/impossible to use this zone**

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/cb1ae746b587c82ea165e0349fb3af82.jpg)

Go to portal 8 and kill Finns. Upgrade your Atk item/Hp item/ Def item 12 times each and your lifesteal item 5 times. You can also upgrade your wings once here. **Same thing as with treants, kirby's will spawn in the middle requiring you to remake if too many spawn.**

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/e27963e070a12476fb9e451a9bfbd9a5.jpg)

Go to portal 9. Kill units there to get upgrade materials. Upgrade your AOE item 15 times. Upgrade your Lifesteal item 10 times. Upgrade your Atk item/ Hp item/ Def item 3 times each. The boss in the bottom right of this area drops 3 upgrade chances, the knights drop 2, soldiers drop 1.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/37a27b272bc325e531d4d25ab90c49b6.jpg)

Go to portal 10. Kill wyverns and upgrade AOE/Lifesteal/Atk/Hp/Def item 10 times each. Upgrade wings once, I recommend upgrading wings first as it gives the largest stat increase, an increase of 15m. 

## There is a method to make wyverns easier. If you drag one wyvern to the bottom left area, kill it once so it does reincarnation then walk away it will stay in that spot, do that 4 more times in the other side areas of the wyvern area until there is only 1 wyvern left in the middle, allowing you to easily farm 1 wyvern.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/ba842e7d6ff7e2210274c0da5ca854fe.jpg)

## Note: From here on make sure you are safe while upgrading items. The zones from this point have stat requirements to enter. If you drop your items to upgrade then die by mistake you will not be able to re-enter. It is best to put your items in your bag while upgrading incase of mistakes.

After you finish killing the wyverns, proceed to this portal located to the east of "-1" town

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/d4e9dc39f04cf2e10f969cc3d7bd0199.png)

Enter this portal and kill Foxy. Upgrade your Atk item/Def item/Wings item/AOE item/Lifesteal item once each.

## Careful about upgrading items inside this boss room, moving around can cause traps to spring which might kill you, and if you aren't wearing enough stat gear you won't be able to re-enter the zone.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e3469376-d16d-44b0-b771-7891c8f0496d)

Enter Hell portal and start with the Red Flame Jewel boss altar on the right. He drops a material which you have to "-create" with the first lifesteal item (Hell Crystal). 
You can find the Hell Crystal by using "-suicide" and moving south to just below the skeleton/abomination zone. 
Once they combine into a new material, it can be used to upgrade your Def item/AOE item/Lifesteal item one time each.

I would recommend bagging a bunch of Hell Crystals or guardian bones and dumping them in your storage area so you don't have to continually move between zones while crafting.

Next we spawn the boss from the Black Jewel boss altar on the left side of the Hell zone.

Enemies near the red pillars (Crystal with blood) get a massive damage buff, so kiting away or breaking the pillars can make fighting the bosses easier.
We use the burning cotton material drop to upgrade our wings one time here.

Next is the Bone Dragon on the south end of the Hell zone, we need to upgrade our wings one time here. Be aware that stepping on the skull piles in this area will spawn a oneshot mob with timed life, so try to walk along the shoreline at the bottom to avoid this. The skull piles can be very hard to spot as they blend into the ground.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/3f3637e0-0b09-4b1a-9eb0-25f08fbc5b2d)

Now it is time to replace your HP item (which was lost during the devil fruit zone) if you haven't already. You'll need to start a new one from the wraith boss above -1, and upgrade it all the way to wyverns in the Pure White Forest portal. In other words, all the way back up to devil fruits. Once that is done, we need to farm the orcs and spiders at the spawn zone (-suicide to get back there) and take the materials to the purifying circle in the skeleton/abomination area further south.

The cooled spider hearts and pure water combine in the purifying circle into a new material (Hope). We need 10 successes on our HP item with that new material.

Once again, its better to dump a bunch of materials in your storage area so you don't have to keep running back and forth. We need to upgrade our HP item 10 times

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/6aebc0ad-12a2-4727-83f5-1874e0b4a481)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/70341ab9-eb29-4c43-8b6a-6b9fda554adb)

Next we move onto the next portal hub area, the Frozen Outskirts. This can also be reached with the "-2" chat command. Entering the zone costs 25 lumber.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/05bc2932-8468-4f59-a636-af375ae75f06)

We start on the top left portal, for Dragon Tail Citadel. We upgrade our HP item once here.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/5d4af22f-06ae-4d49-82d6-dda8f78bbfab)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/5f5b5d14-2c7d-4dba-9e16-d2e949eab65a)

Next it is time to do our tier up (rebirths). Enter the Orc Forest in the -2 portal hub (Frozen Outskirts), and farm skeletons. The white skeletons drop a stacking material, and the yellow skeletons drop a consumable (Stone of Trial) that teleport us to the other mob we need (slimes). We need 70 skeleton materials total (or just 10 if you're only worried about the very first rebirth), and then we will eat a Stone of Trial with our hero while inside the Orc Forest to warp to slimes. 

Make sure you bring your gear piece along using your backpack. There are 3 sizes of slimes, with the next in sequence spawning after you kill the one currently on the map. Run to the right edge of the platform to reach the next slime in the loop. The bigger/harder ones also have a higher droprate. We need 40 slime drops total (or just 5 if you're only worried about the very first rebirth).

Here are the required materials for each rebirth tier, but realistically you just need to collect the amount for rebirth 7 and keep re-using them over and over (since they no longer get consumed)

## Save before using your rebirth materials, if they get eaten then reload in another game as a different player color. Sometimes red player in particular has poor luck with this.

1 = 700k stats + 10x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 5x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

2 = 700k stats + 20x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 10x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

3 = 700k stats + 30x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 15x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

4 = 700k stats + 40x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 20x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

5 = 700k stats + 50x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 25x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

6 = 700k stats + 60x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 30x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

7 = 700k stats + 70x 데몬 스켈레탈 소울(High-level skeletons[white]) + 40x 정체불명의 초록액체(Slimes)

Materials are not consumed upon rebirthing, so you if you just farm a stack of 70 skeletons and 40 slimes, you can reuse them for all 7 rebirths. You can tier up inside the -1 Tower of Ordeal, at the right pillar immediately entering. 

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/32e8afa8-de4c-4821-bef8-d7316c48a441)

After you rebirth, you can -suicide back to spawn and run all the way down to the murloc portal (in snap dragon area) and get 500 pretty fast. Then you can buy back your stats inside the the Stat Workshop (-1 stat farm area) if you can afford it (700 lumber for full stats) or just farm back normally (but slower). 

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/1f6c5d81-d4f9-4e17-8d2b-70339675dd2c)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/283a4c48-f3d7-4c17-8fde-80e4f12edd23)


## You need 700k base stats to rebirth, as well as the required skeleton and slime materials for your current rebirth tier (maximum tier needs 70 skeletons and 40 slimes)

Underneath the Stat Workshop portal is a harder lumber farm zone which you could try if you preferred to just buy back your stats. I'd recommend spawning the lumber vendor's Q mobs, and only moving to the next if those are quite easy (repeating each mob). They get hard really fast. 

There is another portal inside the lumber farm zone that leads to the best farming zone you can reach at this point. Mana ancient can be afk-ed pretty easily and gives 50k lumber on kill. Some abilities might not give kill credit to the player. 

Farm rebirths until you have "7 rings" in your character's class.

After you've rebirthed, your skills will cost mana. We can get a brilliance aura to put in our backpack by going to the little walkway beside the -1 teleport.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/839b12ad-7461-4a5f-82d0-cb03e0d519bb)

Next we're moving on to the Moonlight Stump in -2

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/824f5294-0062-4b45-aaa6-bd236e367d27)

Our lifesteal item upgrades once from Naisha

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/6bdabab3-2297-4fd0-81c8-2a79778af129)

Our AOE item upgrades once from Furbolg

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e03133e6-faf9-491f-97bc-cf0d1e212459)

Our HP item upgrades once from Wildkin

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/c0f6f902-fc3b-41ff-99e1-e3276974ce35)

Upgrade your Def item 3 times from Wolf (Until the item is named Darkness Levi's Cloak)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/d86b4bcc-2dfe-4d79-bf50-be5288ff0250)

Upgrade your HP item 7 times from the Giant. He has two different drops. The Book of visions which has a chance to fail, and book of failed visions which stacks to 30 and guarantees a success. They both upgrade the same item and are interchangeable. Using a stack of failed visions will consume the entire stack, so careful not to have over 30 at a time. The final item will be named Black Valkyrie's Wings. There is a chance the first upgrade in this chain may have to come from the book of visions, and may not work from a stack of failed visions initially (unverified).

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/822d864a-269c-431d-8c2a-60cd8e8a3fb8)

Next we need 7 upgrades on our wings from the thunder lizard. He works the same as the Giant, an Ember of life has a chance to fail and a stack of 30 small embers is a guaranteed success. As a side note, the first upgrade off the thunder lizard has to be from the normal Ember of life, not the stack of 30. After the first upgrade you can use either material.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/fa28d75a-2baa-4ec7-82ed-bba15b208ce5)

Next is the Rock Salt portal in -2. We need the S material and Irhenium to upgrade our Atk item once, and we need Irhenium and a Wing Power Stone to upgrade our wings once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/224777fd-a134-4ea6-84f4-85ef0dbfe6f2)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/b199bf1f-0d72-4afd-8170-157b5dedaa3e)

We can get the Wing Power Stone from the Winged Market, warp -1 and go down into the raid portal. The Winged Market will be on the top right just inside.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/9c58d05b-9349-45d8-bc35-2fbdb6f02485)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/2e639781-5e71-40e9-a504-c15ce023bb06)

If you ever need to farm more lumber, the Mana Spirit in the higher lumber zone is the best method until you get access to the -4 warp later.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e9285a6a-b42e-4fcf-ac31-14b0f42c4478)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/89da67a6-6a2c-41c0-8d76-efd9d2fe4d78)

Our next item upgrade is from the Habitat of giant crabs portal in -2. We need a normal material and an S material to upgrade our Atk item once, and we need a normal material to upgrade our Def item once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/01a24797-859a-4a30-82e5-01a7eaec8684)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/4b1554b3-4e16-4f4c-88f3-6d562fff9480)

Next is the Underworld Boss, which can be reached in the portal hub underneath the -1 teleport. It costs 25 wood to enter. We need a Hell's energy to upgrade our lifesteal item once, and then a Hell's energy + S material to upgrade it again. We also need a Hell's energy to upgrade our HP item once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/2bb9de03-ad88-4c06-8ead-c13df30c49c8)

Next is the Shadow Brigade portal in -2. The miniboss is in the bottom left of the zone, we need 10 Thief's soul pieces to upgrade our AOE item once, and we need 30 Torn Pages from mobs to upgrade our Def item once.

Both the mobs and miniboss drop consumable items which spawn a spider boss inside the portal at the bottom of the zone. We will upgrade our Atk item from those spider drops five times. We need 20 mats, then 20, 30, 30, 35.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/00529bd1-2e29-46d9-9957-8fbf3c8ee210)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/7d5ad67a-ab62-43a5-b2f6-d4a8efcfc13d)

If you're having trouble farming spider, or the upcoming skeleton king/bear/hydra/greed bosses, it is possible to buy any but their S materials from the material shop under -1. I only found difficulty collecting the rare drops from each, but if you'd rather farm lumber off Mana Ancient you can buy out any missing mats when you've farmed the rest of the zone out.

This is also a good time to buy the 30k lumber upgrade from that material shop (Shard fragment of a star) to improve your backpack brilliance aura. You might also consider farming another basic brilliance aura drop as both will stack.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/7a67cd9e-0f5c-40ca-9510-49889ef6ba74)

Now we're on the Soul Corridor portal in -2. He has 3 drops, an S drop, Titans, and remains. We need an S material + 30 Titans to upgrade our Atk item once. We need a remains + 20 Titans to upgrade our lifesteal item once. We will also need 3 separate stacks of 20 Titans (put on floor in stash area) for upgrades in the next zone, but be careful not to stack them all together as they will all be consumed by a single -create.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e767a557-295e-4de3-b6ff-98ad5468c5f4)

Once we have what we need from the skeleton king, it's time to move on to the bear boss in Gomlila's Nest (-2)

The Gorilla (bear) boss has 3 drops, an S material, Fortune Grade Stones and Wind Stones. We need 30 Fortunes to upgrade our Atk item. Then we need 30 Fortunes, 20 Wind Stones, and an S material to upgrade our Atk item again. We need 30 Fortunes and 20 Titans to upgrade our Def item/AoE item and HP item one time each. We will also need 30 Fortunes for an upgrade in the next zone.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/cb3f423d-a2a5-46fa-a5c9-3f4150985719)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/4d8a7e37-81aa-45bc-af67-0fedba21a69b)


After bear comes the Cream Hydra in the wetlands (-2). He also has 3 drops, Early Gray Beans, Hydra Tailbones, and an S material. We need 30 Fortunes and 50 Earl Grays to upgrade our lifesteal item once. We need 50 Earl Gray, 20 Tailbones and an S material to upgrade our Atk item once. Lastly, we need 50 Earl Gray to upgrade our wings once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/d6120370-22b0-4977-bd75-ef149343cbee)

Since we lose the wing visuals this upgrade, if you'd like to have a wing cosmetic effect, you can buy one for 10k lumber at the -1 "go to the winged market" portal. The "New Wings Shop" altars on the top right will provide the visual on your hero when kept in backpack 2.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/7ad1dd03-0fc2-4fee-b749-e3d64c7ad652)

The next boss is Greed in the occupied crossroads (-2). He has two drops, Bitter strong drink and and S material. We need 100 bitter and 10k lumber to upgrade our Def item/HP item once each. We also need 100 bitter, an S material and 10k lumber to upgrade our wings once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/96e54cd3-d9f0-4396-b00e-ec342d1dc03f)

Next we're onto the Grand chamber portal, just under the -1 teleport. You can also use -3 to teleport here, it costs 25 lumber to enter.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/785bdf42-da3e-421f-8f00-28cd1bcdb619)

We start in the Darkroom. The boss here has 3 drops, Evil Crystal, Memories of nightmares and an Epic material. We need one of each and 10k lumber to upgrade our Def item once, and we will also need 2 more Memories of nightmares for the next zones. Fallen angel also drops the cosmetic item Ragna Blade, which works from your backpack.

Next is the Berserker's Tower (-3). He has 2 drops, Vladia and an Epic material. We need both drops, 10k lumber and a Memories of nightmare (from the previous boss) to upgrade our AoE item once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/45b57735-4f0e-4eda-affa-fc69ff367574)

Now we're onto Isabel. He has 2 drops, Shake Crossing Dagger and an Epic material. We need both drops, a Memories of nightmare (from Darkroom), and 20k lumber to upgrade our lifesteal item once. He also drops a cosmetic item, Yuriel.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/111eb08c-4448-4b1f-8fd2-36f25b597daf)

After Isabel we're onto Nereid (-3). He has 3 different drops, Whispers, Rose, and an Epic material. We need two of each drop. A set of each + 50k lumber will upgrade our HP and wings items once. Nereid also drops an Excalibur cosmetic item which provides a golden light weapon effect on some skin models.

Now we're back into the Raid portal room below -1 teleport. The breathtaking desert needs 50 lumber to enter. The boss inside has a normal and an epic drop, we need one of each and 100k lumber to upgrade out Atk item once.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/a7057222-04b4-486a-b5ac-a7febb951541)

Then it's onto the crystal citadel for a lot of drops. We need 4 epic materials, and a total of 12 chests (4 for this zone, and the rest for future areas). Chests have to be taken back to the spawn point (with -suicide), where they can be put on your hero (not backpack) and Appraised with the green crate shop. Spam appraise until the chest drops on the floor. Chests can only be used/saved once they have been successfully appraised.

An epic, chest and 200k lumber will upgrade your wings/HP item/Def item/Atk item once each.

After citadel we move onto the Forest of Jilin. We need a stack of 200 wool, 200k lumber and a Hero's chest (from citadel) to upgrade our AoE item/lifesteal item. Peradux also drops a Count's Cloak cosmetic item for a wing visual.

After that we're onto the last portal hub area, you can reach it by going to -1 and down into raids, then into the Soul Raid portal. You can also use -4, but as far as I can tell, the Red player needs to be able to enter that zone for the -4 teleport command to work.

We're starting at Blanc Bridge and farming aliens. We need 200 mats, 300k lumber and a hero chest per item, upgrading all 6 gear pieces once.

After Aliens it's time to work on our Super Rebirth. For this we need 500 Stimulants (stickman zone, Path of Protection), 400 Gryons (Footman, King of Heroes), and 300 Minotaur (Soul Quarium) mats.

Once you have those, you can pick whatever skin you like for your class from the shops in skeleton rebirth zone (-2, Orc Forest). Each class has 8 options, the default skin, the 3 alternate skins from tier 3, and 4 new super awakening exclusives. You can view all the skins here https://cafe.naver.com/casualrpg?iframe_url=/ArticleRead.nhn%3Fclubid=28897517%26articleid=121002%26referrerAllArticles=true

Take your choice back the the -1 pillar and enjoy.

If you're in the mood, you can go back and farm another brilliance aura item from the Treant in -4 (Woodbella), but by this point I feel characters rely more on their lifesteal item or Def item blink to recover mana. If you want it just to have it, or to afk a little easier then go nuts.

Now that we have alien gear, we can enter the best lumber farm zone, Infinite Dungeon. You can either farm the easier mobs on the left side, or walk to the outside wall to jump across and farm the harder mobs. Wood jam can be stacked and sold to shops, but be careful not to go over 100 or it will sell for over max lumber. Infinite Pieces can be bought from the ? shop inside Infinite Dungeon.

Your next gear comes from Marrowgar (-4), you'll need 500 mats and 20 Infinite Pieces (Infinite Dungeon shop) to upgrade your AoE item once.

Next in line is Accelerator, we need 60 materials and 30 Infinite Pieces to upgrade our HP item once. He also drops the Fairy's Breath cosmetic item.

Now we're onto the Mario zone. We need a total of 1100 Star drops, and 135 Infinite Pieces. We upgrade our Atk item/Def item/wings/lifesteal item once for 200 mats/25 Infinite Pieces each, and upgrade the Atk item a second time for 300 mats/35 Infinite.

Metal Knight time! 1000 mats and 30 Infinite Pieces upgrades our Atk item once. The upgrade only consumes 500 materials, but requires you hold 1000 to -create.

Crystal Bird zone next, the boss and minions drop the same materials. We need 1000 mats and 30 Infinite pieces to upgrade our lifesteal item once. The upgrade consumes 500 materials, but requires you hold 1000 to -create.

Welcome to the last zone. It sucks in here. There are minibosses in each of the 4 corners, and when you kill them they can spawn Return Skeletons and Lord of Nightmares (which are the only two mobs we care about). You might have to kill all 4 minibosses initially to start spawning the big guys, I can't remember/never knew for sure.

Return skeletons drop Icy Rods, and Lord of Nightmares drops Great Wizard Tomes. Spider mobs only drop Infinite Pieces, which could be an alternate area to collect them if you don't wanna use the Infinite Dungeon portal. Don't worry too much about collecting Infinite Pieces, the other mats are going to be the bottleneck. 

We will be upgrading all 6 gear slots, and need a total of 2000 Infinite Pieces, 165 Icy Rods, and 6 Great Wizard Tomes. This works out to 300 Infinite Pieces, 25 Icy Rods and 1 Great Wizard Tome per item (except Atk item). The Atk item needs 500 Infinite Pieces, 40 Icy Rods, and 1 Great Wizard Tome instead.

## I consider these gear upgrades to be worse than the previous tier of equipment. 

## The HP item doesn't gain a better invulnerability cooldown, but has a small chance to summon an invulnerable minion providing 3% armor reduction aura passively. This minion provides no tangible benefit, and will frequently fuck up any afk farming by chasing away mobs (the summon does like 5 dmg). Furthermore, the Atk item upgrade removes the big single target active effect, and now only has a passive proc chance to do very very very small aoe damage around you instead. The Def item retains the same blink but it no longer restores any mana making it a downgrade. The other items seemed about the same as the previous tier, nothing has a description or lists any stats.

Congratulations! You made it to the end of another grindy krpg! Go boost someone or start a new character or something. Or play a better map, god knows why any of us are still playing this one.

## I think the guide is about done, let me know if I fucked anything up or missed something. @Aesgeroth in https://discord.gg/YjVRYfJgEr
