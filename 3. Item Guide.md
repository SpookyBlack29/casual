## Casual RPG Item Guide created by SpookyBlack with help from iFailz, Aesgeroth and tunafish

If playing older map versions, the Korean Command for create: -조합

## If playing the current and final map version (14.3v) then you just use -create


When you reach level 500 you can teleport to the next zones by typing "-1" in chat.

## A recommendation would be to enter the stat farming area and farm stats from the tree at the bottom of the zone. It provides a chance to gain stats every time you attack it. Farming ~15k stats from the tree makes starting off many times easier. The portal to the stat farming area can be found by typing -1 and heading east. Inside you will find this portal. When you enter do not run up into Kirby and Finns, Run down to the right and you will find the tree.

I will refer to items as: Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item/Lifesteal item/ and lastly AOE item

Now that we have some initial stats, it's time to collect our starter gear which will upgrade over the course of the map.

From the first boss that looks like the Knight class obtain the Lifesteal item.

The Wraith will be our first boss, kill her until she drops our item set. This item set will basically be your items you keep all game. **(The wraith can be spawned by killing the red generators under the assassin boss. Upon killing the generator a item will drop, when you activate this item it will spawn 1 wraith to far left of the generator.)**

The crab upgrades can be used with the "-create" chat command.
For older versions that may use the Korean Command for create: -조합


From the crab upgrade Atk item/Def item/ Atk speed item/HP item once.**(Crab may be spawned by killing the generators under the wraith generators.**

**After upgrading from the crab go back to the skeleton and pudge area and obtain one of the runes that drops from the pudges. Purify the rune by walking into this circle.**

The next area will go in order starting from the top left and ending at the bottom middle of the portal room. I am going to refer to the portals as portal 1 to 10 starting with the top left being 1.

To get to these bosses type "-1" and head south to this portal.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/31f0eef6a6ffd2dd0b699d142eacb49d.png)

Go to portal 1 and kill this boss and upgrade your HP item once. Upgrade your Atk item 10 times. Upgrade your Def Item 20 times.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/7b96d93e346cdbd6e0b4b37f7b27d8bc.png)

Go back to the skeleton and pudge area, grab a rune from pudge and purify it like you did when you upgraded your atk speed item. Pick the rune back up and walk back in to upgrade your HP item.

Go to portal 2 and upgrade your weapon 20 times

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/cc4877cbf6e2dc78e8a36edda53a7b6b.jpg)

## Continue collecting upgrade materials in portal 2 and then collect an equal amount from this boss in portal 3 and upgrade your Def item 5 times using both upgrade materials.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/57686f5722acc845abd6f6c4fd825dc3.jpg)

Go to portal 4, kill this boss and upgrade your hp item 5 times.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/f3e1fd7efb1a9b646ec7147ea2633f67.png)

Go to portal 5 kill this boss and upgrade your lifesteal item 5 times.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/ea4bea00a96d347ba22275d4f74220e7.jpg)

Go to portal 6 and kill water elementals. Upgrade your weapon 10 times

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/764d33f9cde3c78e2ca4f14fe2148187.png)

Go to portal 7 and kill the treants. Upgrade your AOE item 15 times. Upgrade your Atk item 5 times. **Mini treants will spawn in the middle as you fight, if you're solo you will need to remake your game every once in a while as they spawn too many for you to kill**

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/cb1ae746b587c82ea165e0349fb3af82.jpg)

Go to portal 8 and kill Finns. Upgrade your Atk item/Hp item/ Def item 12 times each and your lifesteal item 5 times. You can also upgrade your wings once here. **Same thing as with treants, kirby's will spawn in the middle requiring you to remake if too many spawn.**

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/e27963e070a12476fb9e451a9bfbd9a5.jpg)

Go to portal 9. Kill units there to get upgrade materials. Upgrade your AOE item 15 times. Upgrade your Lifesteal item 10 times. Upgrade your Atk item/ Hp item/ Def item 3 times each. The boss in the bottom right of this area drops 3 upgrade chances, the knights drop 2, soldiers drop 1.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/37a27b272bc325e531d4d25ab90c49b6.jpg)

Go to portal 10. Kill wyverns and upgrade AOE/Lifesteal/Atk/Hp/Def item 10 times each. Upgrade wings once, I recommend upgrading wings first as it gives the largest stat increase, an increase of 15m. 

## There is a method to make wyverns easier. If you drag one wyvern to the bottom left area, kill it once so it does reincarnation then walk away it will stay in that spot, do that 4 more times in the other side areas of the wyvern area until there is only 1 wyvern left in the middle, allowing you to easyly farm 1 wyvern.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/ba842e7d6ff7e2210274c0da5ca854fe.jpg)

## Note: From here on make sure you are safe while upgrading items. The zones from this point have stat requirements to enter. If you drop your items to upgrade then die by mistake you will not be able to re-enter. It is best to put your items in your bag while upgrading incase of mistakes.

After you finish killing the wyverns, proceed to this portal located to the east of "-1" town

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/d4e9dc39f04cf2e10f969cc3d7bd0199.png)


Kill the Small Purple Devil Fruit. Use your HP item and the upgrade material to Upgrade your Atk item. Upgrade your Def item /AOE item/Lifesteal item 1 time.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/c856f8ce961431bbab0209ad62ffec63.png)

## While it is not needed immediately, you WILL need to get a new HP item and upgrade it all over again.

Kill the Medium Purple Devil Fruit and upgrade your Atk item/Def item/AOE item/Lifesteal item 1 time each.

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/345e0a44b874e2ef3a13c87c615de952.png)

Enter this portal and kill Foxy. Upgrade your Atk item/Def item/Wings item/AOE item/Lifesteal item once each.

## Careful about upgrading items inside this boss room, moving around can cause traps to spring which might kill you, and if you aren't wearing enough stat gear you won't be able to re-enter the zone.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/e3469376-d16d-44b0-b771-7891c8f0496d)

![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/b844134c948a0108a9cb79d3d5479c42.png)

Enter this portal and kill Northern Puppet. Upgrade your Def item/AOE item/Lifesteal item once each.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/ef0e4038-f80b-47e9-ba8c-a7c4e0b9622e)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/5f796cd7-0fe0-4f7e-8939-a641bddd6862)

Enter Hell portal and start with the Red Flame Jewel boss altar on the right. He drops a material which you have to "-create" with the first lifesteal item (Hell Crystal). 
You can find the Hell Crystal by using "-suicide" and moving south to just below the skeleton/abomination zone. 
Once they combine into a new material, it can be used to upgrade your Def item/AOE item/Lifesteal item one time each.

I would recommend bagging a bunch of Hell Crystals or guardian bones and dumping them in your storage area so you don't have to continually move between zones while crafting.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/d17e24ff-6ba5-4033-ac6d-c5280b4c5ebb)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/9713d4be-666e-4e7f-92e8-48198e924b56)

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/bbb71f26-4e54-4062-8a01-04234d93135e)

Next we spawn the boss from the Black Jewel boss altar on the left side of the Hell zone.

Enemies near the red pillars (Crystal with blood) get a massive damage buff, so kiting away or breaking the pillars can make fighting the bosses easier.
We use the burning cotton material drop to upgrade our wings one time here.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/a2385b96-0027-4251-a673-9262dfdbbba9)

Next is the Bone Dragon on the south end of the Hell zone, we need to upgrade our wings one time here. Be aware that stepping on the skull piles in this area will spawn a oneshot mob with timed life, so try to walk along the shoreline at the bottom to avoid this. The skull piles can be very hard to spot as they blend into the ground.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/3f3637e0-0b09-4b1a-9eb0-25f08fbc5b2d)

Now it is time to replace your HP item (which was lost during the devil fruit zone) if you haven't already. You'll need to start a new one from the wraith boss above -1, and upgrade it all the way to wyverns in the Pure White Forest portal. In other words, all the way back up to devil fruits. Once that is done, we need to farm the orcs and spiders at the spawn zone (-suicide to get back there) and take the materials to the purifying circle in the skeleton/abomination area further south.

The cooled spider hearts and pure water combine in the purifying circle into a new material (Hope). We need 10 successes on our HP item with that new material.

Once again, its better to dump a bunch of materials in your storage area so you don't have to keep running back and forth. We need to upgrade our HP item 10 times

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/70341ab9-eb29-4c43-8b6a-6b9fda554adb)

Next we move onto the next portal hub area, the Frozen Outskirts. This can also be reached with the "-2" chat command. Entering the zone costs 25 lumber.

![image](https://github.com/SpookyBlack29/casual/assets/41921856/05bc2932-8468-4f59-a636-af375ae75f06)

We start on the top left portal, for Dragon Tail Citadel. We upgrade our HP item once here.
