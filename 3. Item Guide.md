## A reccomendation would be to enter the stat farming area and farm stats from the tree, It provides a 10% chance to gain 50 stats everytime you attack it. Farming 5-10k stats from the tree makes starting off many times easier. The portal to the stat farming area can be found by typing -1 and heading east. Inside you will find this portal. When you enter do not run up into Kirby and Finns, Run down to the right and you will find the tree.
